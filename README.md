Cricinfo Tweaks is a cross-platform browser addon for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox that aims to help make cricket stats that would otherwise just be rows in a table, a little bit easier to understand. It does this by injecting simple interactive graphs into player stats pages on ESPNCricinfo helping with visualising relationships and trends.
