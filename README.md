## Introduction
Cricinfo Tweaks is a Firefox Addon that aims to help make cricket stats that would otherwise just be rows in a table, a little bit easier to understand. It does this by injecting simple interactive graphs into player stats pages on ESPNCricinfo helping with visualising relationships and trends.

## How to Use

Donwload the addon from the Releases page: https://github.com/rv3392/cricinfo-tweaks/releases.

Once installed, simply navigate to any page with a URL of the form https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/<cricketer id>/bowling-batting-stats to get started.

## Future Plans

This is a prototype - just one of many ways solutions for the problem - so there aren't many long-term plans. In the short-term future, I plan on adding support for Google Chrome and supporting Statsguru pages.

### Todos

- [ ] Support Google Chrome
- [ ] Graphs on Statsguru
