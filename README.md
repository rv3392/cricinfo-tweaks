# Cricinfo Tweaks
## Introduction
This is a Firefox Addon that adds graphs and other features to the stats pages at www.espncricinfo.com. There is
currently no support for Chrome, however this is planned once the core features are complete.

This is still in early development, however it aims to allow quick and easy visualisation of players stats within player profiles.
Eventually, it is expected that this will support Statsguru with the aim of supporting most queries available there.

## How to Use
Currently the only way to use this is to clone this repo and load as a temporary add-on using about:debugging.
Releasing a pre-release version is high on my list of priorities.
